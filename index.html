        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>
          Hey I am Jaspreet Singh. I also go by Jazzy. I graduated from Lakota
          West High School with a 4.7 GPA in my senior year. I was top 10% of my
          graduating class. I won a gold scholastics award as well as an
          honorable mention in Arts (drawing and painting). Earned a CDL License
          from Napier Truck Driving School. I love meeting new people and
          expanding my network. I also love singing, acting, and working out. I
          also have a YouTube channel for entertaining purposes. I am on a
          bulking phase right now, I have gained 50 pounds over the last 2
          years. I plan to go to 180 lbs by the end of this year, and eventually
          200lbs, and I will make it happen. My greatest motivation for
          everything I do is my thinking that there are people out there that
          need help and guidance, but no one is helping them, and I think God
          has chosen me to help them. This is what keeps me going, and I think
          it will inspire you as well. I'm always looking for new opportunities
          that can help me become a well-rounded person.
